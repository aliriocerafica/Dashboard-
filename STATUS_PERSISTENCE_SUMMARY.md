# Status Persistence & Email Notifications - Summary

## âœ… What's Fixed

### Problem 1: Status Reverts to Pending on Refresh
**Before**: Status changed in admin panel but reverted when page refreshed
**Now**: Status is automatically saved to Google Sheets

### Problem 2: Email Sending
**Before**: Emails were only simulated (not actually sent)
**Now**: Real emails sent via EmailJS service

---

## How It Works Now

### 1. Status Update Flow
```
Admin clicks status button (e.g., "Approved")
        â†“
API call to /api/update-request-status
        â†“
Google Sheets updated with new status
        â†“
Email sent to requester via EmailJS
        â†“
Success message shown to admin
```

### 2. Google Sheets Integration
- Status changes are saved directly to Column H in your Google Sheet
- Uses Google Sheets API to find and update the exact row
- Persistent storage - won't revert on refresh

### 3. Email Service Options

#### Current Options:
1. **EmailJS** (Free, Recommended)
   - 200 emails/month free
   - Setup in 5 minutes
   - Works with Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.
   - Follow: `EMAILJS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

2. **No Email Service** (Demo Mode)
   - Status still saves to Google Sheets âœ…
   - Emails logged to console only
   - Shows simulated success message

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **app/api/update-request-status/route.ts**
   - Now saves status to Google Sheets
   - Integrates with EmailJS API
   - Finds row by Request ID and updates Column H

2. **.env.local**
   - Added EmailJS configuration placeholders
   - Ready for your credentials

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/update-request-status
Body: {
  requestId: string,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  asset: string,
  status: string
}
Returns: { success: boolean, message: string }
```

Status updates save to Google Sheets automatically
Just click status buttons and refresh - status persists!

### Full Setup (With Real Emails)
1. Sign up at https://www.emailjs.com
2. Connect Gmail or Outlook account
3. Create email template
4. Get API credentials (3 values)
5. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
   EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
   EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   ```
6. Restart dev server
7. Test: Update status â†’ Check email inbox

**Detailed guide**: See `EMAILJS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

## Testing

### Test Status Persistence
1. Visit `/admin/it-requests` (login first)
2. Click a status button (e.g., "Approved")
3. Refresh page (Ctrl+R)
4. Status stays the same âœ…

### Test Email Sending (requires EmailJS setup)
1. Submit request at `/it-asset-request`
2. Update status in admin panel
3. Check email inbox of requester
4. Receive status update email âœ…

## Status Messages

When status is updated, requester receives:

**Approved**: "Your IT asset request has been APPROVED. Your item will be delivered soon!"

**Declined**: "Your IT asset request has been DECLINED. Please contact IT for more information."

**In Process**: "Your IT asset request is IN PROCESS. We are working on your request."
